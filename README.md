# Target-Detection-for-Droplet-Microfluidic
Target Detection-based Real-time Monitoring Platform for Droplet Microfluidic Systems

This program is built around the YOLO model as its core to establish a real-time microfluidic droplet detection system. The model folder contains the output files generated after training, including the weight file and performance reports such as the confusion matrix. mark2.pt is the trained weight model. analyzer.ipynb can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to perform real-time detection tasks and generate detection reports.

main_beta04.py and other Python files constitute an integrated program with pressure control interfaces, where main_beta04.py serves as the main program while the remaining files function as subroutines or configuration files. This program demonstrates the potential of the trained model for automated control in production environments.
